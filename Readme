# 🌱 SpringEmployeeHub

Welcome to **SpringEmployeeHub** — a real-time, fully functional Employee Management System developed using **Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and MySQL**! 🚀  
This project showcases my backend development journey — combining clean architecture, modern design, and hands-on learning with CRUD operations.
